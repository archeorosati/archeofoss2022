**Proposal text**

The purpose of my paper is to present the QGIS plugin ArcheoloGIS. ArcheoloGIS is a 'processing toolkit' developed in PyQgis and tested by the community Una Quantum inc. Once download from GitHub (https://github.com/archeorosati/archaeoloGIS) and “installed as a ZIP folder” the toolkit will be in the “processing tools”.
There are in the toolkit 3 algorithms named Tabula Peutingeriana, Eratosthenes, Darius. They are respectively working on the Roman, Greek/Hellenistic, Persian road network. The “Tabula Peutingeriana” algorithm is the first algorithm programmed and the principles are the same in the other. Given a road network, basically made in lines, designed according to certain criteria i.e. start the network from the central city, continue the network from the primary road to the secondary, third … snap the vertex. The algorithm will return points instead on the lines of the road, positioning the milestones (eventually helping to find them or their original position), counting the roman miles from the center of the network and the kilometre. Using that it is primarily possible to prove whether the reconstruction of the road network corresponds to the indications of ancient sources (in particular the Tabula Peutingeriana).
In another way it is to find informations about the recurrence of the mail or horse-exchange stations, taverns, and reach other statistics.
The other two algorithms are quite similar Eratosthenes works with the unit of measurement of the 'Greek Stadia' in the Hellenistic era, Darius with the Persian Parasangas. After showing the code, the plugin construction workflow and its evolution, case studies and reflections on two areas of the ancient Mediterranean will be presented during the paper.
